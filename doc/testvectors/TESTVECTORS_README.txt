These test vectors can be used to validate that an implementation conforms to the U-Prove Cryptographic Specification V1.1 Revision 4. They were generated using the [U-Prove C# SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/uprove-csharp-sdk/tree/master/UProveTestVectors).

The testvectors_hashing.txt file contains hash formatting test vectors.

The other files contain values of protocol runs with different numbers of disclosed attributes (D) for the Lite version of the protocol, using the elliptic curve construction.
